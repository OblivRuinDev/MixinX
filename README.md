Powerful tool for Aspect Oriented Programming and bytecode injection.

We are committed to providing a powerful, high-performance AOP tool.

This project is in early development process.

## Future Plan
1. **Automatic Mixin Application from Cache Files**  
   Automatically apply mixins using pre-generated cache files.
   Also do some checks before apply to prevent applying out-of-date bytecode.
2. **Asynchronous Parsing and Application**  
   Parse mixin classes and apply injections asynchronously for better performance.
3. **Preloading and Proactive Injection**  
   Preload classes and apply mixins before they are actually needed in the program.
4. **Smart Analysis and Policy Generation**  
   Analyze mixin patterns and generate optimization policies intelligently.
